# Makefile Documentation

This document describes all available Makefile targets for the CodexDB project.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Most common commands
make build          # Build the CLI

## Shortcuts

Quick single-letter commands:

```bash
make t    # Same as: make test
make c    # Same as: make clean
make b    # Same as: make build
make r    # Same as: make run-cli
```

## Info Target

### `make info`

```bash
make info
```

## Common Workflows

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development
make dev              # Run quick checks

# Make changes...

# Test changes
make test-verbose     # See detailed test output

# Before commit
make check           # Run all quality checks
```

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Check coverage
make test-coverage

# View detailed coverage
make coverage-html

# Test for race conditions
make test-race

# Run benchmarks
make benchmark
```

### Release Workflow

```bash
# Pre-release checks
make pre-release

# Build release binary
make build

# Install for testing
make install

# Test installation
codex-cli --help
```

### CI/CD Workflow

```bash
# Local CI simulation
make ci-full

# Quick CI check
make ci
```

## Environment Variables

The Makefile respects the following environment variables:

- `GO` - Go command (default: `go`)
- `GOFLAGS` - Additional Go flags (default: `-v`)

Example:
```bash
GO=go1.21 make build
GOFLAGS="-v -x" make test
```

## Output Colors

The Makefile uses colored output for better readability:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Success messages
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Warnings and informational messages
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Section headers
- **Bold**: Command names and important text

## Parallel Execution

Run multiple targets in parallel (where safe):

```bash
# NOT recommended - may cause conflicts
make -j4 test benchmark

# Safe parallel execution
make fmt & make vet & wait
```

## Troubleshooting

### "make: command not found"

Install make:
```bash
# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Linux
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### "golangci-lint: command not found"

Install linter:
```bash
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```

### "entr: command not found"

Install entr for watch functionality:
```bash
# macOS
brew install entr

# Linux
sudo apt-get install entr
```

### Coverage files not found

Run tests first:
```bash
make test-coverage
make coverage-html
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use `make help`** to see all available commands
2. **Run `make check`** before committing
3. **Use `make watch`** during active development
4. **Run `make pre-release`** before creating releases
5. **Check `make info`** to understand project structure
6. **Use shortcuts** (`make t`, `make b`) for quick commands
7. **Combine targets** for complex workflows: `make clean build test`

## Integration with IDEs

### VS Code

Add to `.vscode/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "make test",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "make test",
      "group": "test"
    },
    {
      "label": "make build",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "make build",
      "group": "build"
    }
  ]
}
```

### GoLand / IntelliJ

1. Run â†’ Edit Configurations
2. Add â†’ Makefile
3. Select target from dropdown

## Customization

To add custom targets, edit the Makefile:

```makefile
my-target: ## Description shown in help
	@echo "Running my custom target"
	# Your commands here
```

The `##` comment becomes the help text shown in `make help`.

## Getting Help

- Run `make help` for command list
- Check individual command documentation above
- See [README.md](README.md) for project overview
- See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for testing details
