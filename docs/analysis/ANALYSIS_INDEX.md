## Component Analysis Summary

### Core Store (418 LOC)
- Simple, intuitive API: Set, Get, Delete, Keys, Has, Clear, Close
- Batch operations: 10-50x performance improvement
- Thread-safe with RWMutex
- Two storage modes: Snapshot vs Ledger

### Storage Layer
**Snapshot Mode** (Full copy on write)
- Strategy: Full database serialization each write
- Performance: O(n) writes, O(1) reads
- Best for: Read-heavy workloads

**Ledger Mode** (Append-only log)
- Strategy: Sequential operation log
- Performance: O(1) writes, O(n) on load
- Best for: Audit trails, high write throughput

### Encryption (AES-GCM)
- Algorithm: AES-256 in GCM mode (authenticated encryption)
- Key Sizes: 128, 192, 256 bits
- Nonce: 12 bytes, cryptographically random per encryption
- Security: AEAD prevents tampering

### Compression
- Algorithms: Gzip (5-10x), Zstd (10-20x), Snappy (2-4x), None
- Implementation: 2-byte header with auto-detection
- Performance: Zstd best for repetitive data, Snappy fastest

### Batch Operations
- Pattern: Builder with fluent API
- Performance: Single disk write for multiple operations
- Optimization: Removes duplicate key updates
- Atomic: Full transaction semantics

### Atomic File Operations
- Pattern: Write-rename (crash-safe)
- Durability: fsync() + directory sync
- Safety: Process crash = untouched original file

## Testing Summary

### Test Coverage
- **Core Functionality**: TestSetAndGet, TestDelete, TestClear, TestHas, TestKeys (all passing)
- **Persistence**: Data survives close/reopen cycles
- **Concurrency**: 8+ seconds stress testing (all passing)
- **Encryption**: All key sizes and algorithms
- **Compression**: All algorithms, edge cases
- **Batch Operations**: Atomic updates, optimization
- **Integration**: Complex scenarios, edge cases
- **Performance**: Benchmarks, high-volume testing

### Test Pattern Quality
- Table-driven tests for parameter variation
- Subtests for organized test suites
- Temporary directories for isolation
- Integration tests for end-to-end validation
- Performance benchmarks for regression detection

## Security Assessment

### Strengths
- AES-256-GCM (industry standard)
- Authenticated encryption prevents tampering
- Cryptographic randomness (crypto/rand)
- Key validation at creation time
- SHA256 integrity checksums
- Atomic operations prevent corruption
- Audit trail support (ledger mode)

### Minor Issues
- Backup files use 0644 permissions (world-readable) - should be 0600
- No key derivation function (user responsibility)
- No built-in key rotation API

### Overall Security Posture
**STRONG** - Suitable for protecting sensitive data with proper key management

## Best Use Cases

### Ideal For
- Configuration management
- Session storage
- Lightweight caching
- Desktop applications
- Small to medium services (<1GB data)
- Encrypted data persistence
- Audit logs (ledger mode)

### Not Suitable For
- Very large datasets (all data in memory)
- Extreme write throughput (global lock)
- Complex queries (key-value only)
- Multi-process access (single file)
- Distributed systems

## Recommendations by Priority

### HIGH PRIORITY (Easy, High Impact)
1. **Backup File Permissions**: Change 0644 to 0600 for security consistency
2. **Document Limitations**: Explicitly state memory limits, single-file design in README
3. **Architecture Diagram**: Add visual representation to documentation

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Moderate Effort)
1. **Key Rotation API**: Add `MigrateEncryption(oldKey, newKey)` method
2. **Ledger Optimization**: Implement checkpoint snapshots for faster startup
3. **Logger Integration**: Use logger package for operation tracing
4. **CLI JSON Output**: Support `--json` flag for programmatic use

### LOW PRIORITY (Complex/Nice-to-Have)
1. **Per-Key Locking**: Enable concurrent writes to different keys
2. **Streaming API**: Iterator for large datasets
3. **CLI Enhancements**: export/import/validate commands

## Code Quality Observations

### Excellent Practices
- ✓ Consistent fmt.Errorf with %w wrapping (72+ instances)
- ✓ Proper defer-based cleanup (89 instances)
- ✓ No silent error swallowing
- ✓ Thread-safe with proper lock management
- ✓ Clean separation of concerns
- ✓ Minimal external dependencies
- ✓ Comprehensive test coverage

### Areas for Improvement
- ⚠ Some internal functions lack documentation
- ⚠ No architectural overview diagram
- ⚠ Backup file permissions (minor security issue)
- ⚠ No key derivation support

## Bottleneck Analysis

### Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Snapshot Mode JSON Marshaling**
   - Impact: Full database serialized on every write
   - Mitigation: Batch operations (10-50x improvement)
   - Acceptance: Good for small-medium datasets

2. **Ledger Mode Replay**
   - Impact: O(n) startup time for large logs
   - Mitigation: None in current design
   - Suggestion: Checkpoint snapshots

3. **Global Store Lock**
   - Impact: All writes serialized globally
   - Mitigation: Batch operations reduce acquisitions
   - Suggestion: Per-key sharding for scaling

4. **Compression/Encryption Overhead**
   - Impact: Applied per operation
   - Mitigation: Optional (disabled by default)
   - Acceptance: Trade-off for security

## Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy**: Storer interface (Snapshot vs Ledger)
- **Builder**: Batch fluent API
- **Adapter**: Options configuration
- **Decorator**: Compression/Encryption layers

### Extension Points
- **Easy**: New compression algorithms, storage strategies
- **Hard**: Key management, per-key locking, streaming
