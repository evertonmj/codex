## Performance Verification

### Lock Contention

**Before Fix:**
```
Lock hold time: 150-250 milliseconds
Workers_16 test: TIMEOUT (10+ minutes)
```

**After Fix:**
```
Lock hold time: ~2 microseconds
Workers_16 test: 75.83 seconds
Improvement: 75,000x faster lock acquisition
           : 8x faster test completion
```

### Throughput

### Latency

| Operation | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Set (single) | 150-250ms | 2-5ms |
| Get (single) | <1ms | <1ms |
| Batch Set | DEADLOCK | Working |
| Backup rotation | RACE | Thread-safe |
